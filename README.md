# Topological
A topological map editor for creating and editing topological maps commonly used in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) deployments. 

## Introduction
Topological navigation in robotics is the mapping of paths that robots will use to get from point A to point B. A topological 
map is usually shown in terms of a graph. For further information, try here: http://cs.krisbeevers.com/mapping.html. 
This application is designed for editing existing topological map files in the following formats:

 * TMAP
 * YAML
 * PGM
 
 This is a cross-platform Python application. Pre-packaged versions are available from the 'Releases' section on GitHub.

## Project Objectives
 * Create a graphical editor for topological maps
 * Work with existing files (tmap, yaml, pgm)
 * Increase efficiency of editing nodes
